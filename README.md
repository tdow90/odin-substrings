# odin-substrings

I have been working through the odin project for the past month or two. I have been stuggling to enjoy ruby, but have recently started looking at pythong again. So I started watching the CS50 Intro to Web programming with Pythong and JS. Im hoping to combine this course and the odin project curriculum to get a solid foundation in web programming. I will use python/django, but combine some of the Db and deployment courses, plus all the HTML, Css and JS lessons from the odin project. 

This is the first project after swithcing from Ruby back to Python.
